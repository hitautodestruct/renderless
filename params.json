{"name":"Renderless","tagline":"A small PHP script for rendering lesscss on the fly.","body":"##What?\r\nRenderless is a small script for generating and concatenating minified [less](http://lesscss.org/) and css files either on the fly or to a single file using PHP.\r\nRenderless uses the [lessphp](http://leafo.net/lessphp/) library to generate less files.\r\n\r\n##How?\r\n\r\n###Setup\r\nSimply download both files (`lessc.inc.php` and `renderless.php`) and place them in one of your directories in your project:\r\n\r\n`myproject\\renderless.php`\r\n`myproject\\lessc.inc.php`\r\n\r\nOpen up `renderless.php` in an editor and configure your settings:\r\n\r\n`$input_dir`: A relative path to your css/less files. The path should be relative to where the renderless.php file is located.\r\n\r\n`$output_file`: If this variable is defined renderless will output a compiled css file. Again, this is relative to where renderless.php is located.\r\n\r\n`$pointer_file`: You can specify a single file for renderless to render, the file can include @import statements and act as an organizer.\r\n\r\n###Manually generate a css file\r\nOnce this is done you can manually render the css/less file by accessing it in your browser.\r\nJust type in the path to the file i.e. `http://localhost/myproject/renderless.php`.\r\nIf you've set up the `$output_file` option renderless will create a compiled css file according to what you wrote.\r\n\r\n###Render the code on the fly\r\nIf you want renderless to act as an immediate interpreter you can point your style declaration to the renderless.php file in your html like so:\r\n\r\n**WARNING**: This script has no caching method so it is advised to not use it in a production environment. Use the manual option instead.\r\n```html\r\n<link href=\"renderless.php\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nFore debugging your css you can also use the `min` query string and renderless will not minify your code:\r\n```html\r\n<link href=\"renderless.php?min=0\" ... >\r\n```","google":"UA-40483579-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
